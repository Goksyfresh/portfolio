# My Journey Building a Startup MVP

On a boring Thursday afternoon, a bright idea struck me. I sprang up from my couch, grabbed my journal and pen, and started writing. Within minutes, I was sitting by my “workspace”—or rather, my laptop on my lap, since I didn’t have a proper desk—and engaged ChatGPT to validate the thoughts in my head.  

Having recently learned the MERN stack, my first step was to ensure this app could be built with it—and yes, it could. I dove into planning the architecture and features of the app. The satisfaction that came with being the founder of a potential startup fueled my drive to make sure it saw the light of day.

## Backend Development

The backend took off almost immediately. I wrote schemas, handled authentication logic, and built endpoints to:

- Create a game  
- Fetch existing games  
- Join games  
- Update user profiles  

Of course, it wasn’t without bugs. What’s a coding session without hours lost debugging silly mistakes? Despite that, the backend was completed in a reasonable time.

In retrospect, if I were to start over, I might reconsider using MongoDB and lean towards a backend-as-a-service. Incorporating Google Sign-In and Apple Sign-In into a MERN app proved challenging, and these integrations could have provided a better user experience for signing up quickly.

## Frontend Challenges

The camel that broke the camel’s back was my choice of frontend framework. I chose React Native, assuming it was the obvious choice for building an app—but little did I know, it would complicate certain aspects of my startup’s journey.  

Design was another major hurdle. As a solo developer, I had neither the budget nor a designer on my team. I returned to my journal, wireframing ideas, and after many crumpled papers thrown in the bin in a fashion Steph Curry would be proud of, I came up with a decent enough UI. Whether the UX was truly great remained unclear.

I built the onboarding and authentication pages first, hooked the backend, and everything worked perfectly. From there, I tackled the homepage and other tabs, still debating illustrations and color schemes. Eventually, the app came together and was functional enough to pass as an MVP.

## Launch Struggles

I was thrilled—I truly believed this app would take off. It solved a real problem, and I expected a flood of users. I ignored marketing, confident that good user experience is enough to guarantee success. Budget constraints were partly to blame for this blind spot.

The MVP was ready, but a new challenge arose: sharing it with potential users when it wasn’t hosted on the App Store or Play Store. I didn’t have the funding to do either. In hindsight, I made what might have been a mistake—I screen recorded the app to show users its functionality.

I posted the recording on [X](https://x.com/oyegoke19/status/1895226381887512891?s=46) and received around 8,000 views. I hoped these views would translate into getting real life users, but without a platform to actually share the app, that traction was lost.  

To address this, I decided to convert my React Native app to a web app. The process took longer than expected, and by the time it was ready, the initial audience had moved on.

## Reflection

I was dejected. Despite pouring blood, sweat, and tears into this product, I didn’t have active users. But the experience was invaluable. I learned lessons about:

- Choosing the right tech stack  
- The importance of easy onboarding (Google/Apple Sign-In)  
- The challenge of marketing and distribution for MVPs  
- Product design as a solo developer  

With the right approach, this is a challenge I’d love to tackle again. The journey has taught me more than any tutorial ever could, and I’m eager to apply these lessons to the next project.
